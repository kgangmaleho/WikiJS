### Grid Features

The grid has multiple features that allows users to reorganize and
reformat data:

  - Column Filtering ![](src/media/image52.png) will allow users to
    filter by a specific columnâs values.

  - Column sorting will sort the gridâs data by a specific columnâs
    values, either ascending or descending. This can be done by clicking
    on the column header. Clicking subsequent times after the first will
    toggle the sort order.

  - Column grouping will group the data by a columnâs values. This is
    done by dragging and dropping the column header into the space just
    above the grid. The grid can be grouped by multiple columns in this
    way.

  - Column searching allows users to enter a search term for a specific
    column. The columnâs search bar is beneath the column header.

# Weekly Task Scheduler

The weekly Task scheduler has a number of update tasks that will run
every Sunday at 03:00 AM. While most of these processes are automatic
and require no further intervention, two of these processes use data
files that will need to be acquired from outside the system. These files
can be found in the "FlatFiles" folder in the directory the system is
being hosted from.

## Models Flat File

This file contains the model information stored in the database. This
file is named "motovate\_carprice.txt" and it is important to note that
the same filename must be used when the file is copied.

## Part Price Flat File

This file contains the Part Price information stored in the database.
This file is named "DPF.ET2000.RETAIL" and it is important to note that
the same filename must be used when the file is copied.

## Vehicle Service History Flat

This file contains the Vehicle Service History information stored in the
database. This file is named "Sample Service Data" and it is important
